              You don&apos;t go out of the browser during the test, this may
              automatically end the session.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don&apos;t open new tabs or move to other sites, as this may

              Be careful to stabilize your internet, because losing connectivity
              can result in losing your test progress.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allocate enough time to answer all the questions, as the pause or
              re-attempt cannot be put on hold immediately after the start.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose a quiet, distraction-free place to ensure your focus during
              the solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              No external sources such as search engines or references are
              allowed to be used during the test.

              Once the test starts, you won&apos;t be able to go back to
              previous questions, so make sure you answer before moving on to
              the next one.
